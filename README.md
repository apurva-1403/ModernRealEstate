# ModernRealEstate

This is my first Machine Learning model using python for predicting house prices. 

While working on this projects I explored various things in machine learning like:
- how to do comprehensive analysis of a problem involving data collection, 
- importing it into a Jupyter notebook, 
- identifying valuable attributes, 
- exploring correlations, 
- visualizing data through graphs, 
- building a pipeline, 
- addressing missing values, and more.

I actively used concepts like **cross-validation**, **train-test splitting**, **stratified shuffle split**, and **sampling** throughout the project. By employing these techniques, I hoped to improve my understanding of how they can be implemented successfully in real world projects.
